            <p>At Pacific NW Dentistry, we know that you have a lot of options when selecting your dentist.  We are honored that you are reading this and considering us being our patient. We will do our best to meet and exceed your expectation.
                We are a small team, and we focus more on quality vs quantity.  You will not be rushed during your appointment, and you will have plenty of time to answer us questions.  We are all digital and use the latest technology to make your visit with us a pleasant one.  All our operatories are equipped with a TV (Netflix) and we played your music of choice during the appointment.  We also have nitrous if you are anxious.  Our main operatory also has a massage chair.
                From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you will be taken care of.  We try not to overbook our schedule, so that you wonâ€™t have to stay in the waiting room for too long.  We value your time, and we hope that you also value our time with you.
                Please let us know if there is anything we can do  to make your visit better.
                Dr. Banh and his dedicated team.</p>
