                As a dentist, I'm often asked a lot of questions about oral health from patients, friends, colleagues, and family.
                I receive a lot of dental information by mail, subscription, and emails. I also attend a lot of dental courses.
                Being an affiliate instructor at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, I am in constant contact with
                world-renowned faculties, specialists, and dentists. I hope to gather as much information from different sources
                and share them with you, providing interesting and useful information about your oral health. If there is anything
                you want to ask me, please contact me at drbanh@pacificnwdentistry.com.
            </p>
