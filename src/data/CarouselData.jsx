        content: "Absolutely the best dentist I have had thus far. I've had 3 dentists since I was 3 years old - my first having retired when I was in high school and therefore I had to switch a few times after. I had extreme mouth pain caused by newly receding gums as well as a couple chipped fillings that happened during my pregnancy. I went to 2 dentists to address my concerns however both were unable to treat the issue with my teeth sensitivity from dentin exposure. Through Dr. Banh, I was able to learn that my teeth have an odd genetic anomaly that exposed a small portion of my pre-molars on the side, where there is no enamel protection and therefore caused extreme sensitivity to cold and hot foods, even semi-cold water, and regular teeth brushing. Both the other 2 dentists I previously went to said there was nothing they could do even though I was able to research and find out there are some temporary methods available to help ease the pain (i.e. dental sealants). Per my husband's recommendation, I decided to meet with Dr. Banh. They were able to get me an emergency appointment the day after I called expressing my concerns. From there, Dr. Banh went over my x-rays (2D and 3D) as well as taking actual pictures inside my mouth to investigate and help explain what could be happening. He has incredible bedside manner and really takes the time to listen to your concerns and gives you the best possible option(s) with the least amount of physical trauma being done to your teeth. Thanks to his recommendations, I was able to get some temporary dental sealants applied (sealants lasts ~2-3 mo depending), and I felt IMMEDIATE relief after having dealt with this for 3+ weeks. I am FINALLY able to comfortably eat again thanks to him! I definitely plan to continue seeing him for all my dental needs/cleanings, and have already recommended my family and friends to transfer to him as well.",

        content: "My review is long overdue.  Dr. Banh is a great dentist!  I'm so glad we found him.  I usually don't have problems with my teeth, so it's only been checkups & cleanings for me but each time it's been a pleasant experience.  The Dental hygienist I've had has been great and all the staff there are courteous, friendly, and helpful.  The office is clean and they try to make the experience as less painful and stressful as possible.  Dr. Banh is personable and takes the time to explain things as well as answer any questions you may have.  He gives you a detailed picture of what's going on with your teeth and brings out teeth models as well to explain things.  If he weren't a dentist, I think he'd be a great educator.  From the interactions I've had, I think he enjoys educating people and I can tell that he's passionate and cares about the work he does.  I haven't gone myself since the pandemic as I tend to have a weaker immune system so I try to stay away from establishments as a precaution for myself but my family members have gone recently and they haven't had any problems.  The office is taking the necessary precautions such as taking all incoming people's temperature, everyone wears masks, and nobody waits in the waiting room.  I think they schedule things well so that you're not bumping into other patients as you're coming in or leaving.",

The Dr used a lot positive affirmations throughout the procedure and even let me hold an extra suction tool so I could feel in control of the situation. I love this place, it is the first time a dentist and staff have taken the time to get to know me. Kuddos- I think I found my permanent dental team.",

        Dr. Banh is wonderful to work with! He understands my dental fears and anxiety and is great at checking in with me frequently during treatments to make sure I am okay.
        Victoria at the front desk is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and super efficient at getting referrals in to my insurance company promptly.
        I will never see another dentist again, Dr. Banh is my dentist for life!`,

        content: "Thanks to Pacific NW Dentistry, I was able to get past my dental fear. The first time I went in, I hadn’t been to the dentist in about 10 years. The staff is all kind and helpful, they explain what they are doing every step of the way, and they do what they can to make you feel as comfortable as possible. They give you the option of listening to the music of your choice which is nice. They also take tooth pictures so you can see the work being done, and you never feel like you’re having unnecessary work done. They offer reminder texts and calls as well. I won’t go to any other dentist as long as Dr. Banh has his practice! Highly recommend.",
